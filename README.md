**Intro**
  
This project is a responsive website about the explorer Jacques Cousteau, highlighting various places he has visited in the U.S. This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes including laptops, tablets, and mobile phones, and is designed to be appealing across all resolutions.

For this project, I utilized the design tool Figma, which provided a template detailing the project specifications. Utilizing this tool I created a replica of the template by writing all the required code.

I employed techniques such as grid and flex display styles. Utilizing both grid and flex helped maintain the necessary layouts across different resolutions.
